# Max's magical lab computer counter

# Outdated!

This script, though good back in the day, no longer works; the basement labs switched to a kerberized NFS and the ssh authentication was updated to provide greater security. I have since rewritten the core of this script to use *expect*, but have not posted it online yet, as there are still changes to be made. The Academic Computing Services are in the process of constant change when it comes to what they allow and don't allow the lab computers to do. 

For now, I will leave this here as a stand in, for sake of not having to create a new repo when I finally get around to updating the script.

# Previous instructions for use:

step one: log on to UCSD's ieng6 server

step two: replace the ssh username in this script with your own!

step three: run!

step four: count the open computers!
